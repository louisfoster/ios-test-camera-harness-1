## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

Following on from my attempt at making a tile-map based environment, [here](https://louisfoster.github.io/ios-test-level-map-1/), I realised I needed a couple of things in order to flesh it out a bit. Plus, I was getting a little tired of levels so I needed something else to work on anyway. This project explores management of an abstract "harness" which is given a node to track, ostensibly it's parent, and a node to hold onto, ostensibly a child of it's child "harness" node. It's primarily utilised for management of the camera positions in relation to the player's character or some object of interest.
